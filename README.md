# Deep-Learning-Homework2

Shailesh Alluri

Since I was facing some issues while running on palmetto, I have run the program on my local PC.
Both the training and testing are done on Jupyter Notebook.

To run these files, the following libraries are required:
python 3.8
Pytorch 1.7
Tensorflow 2.4
Matplotlib 3.2.2
Numpy 1.19

train file - train.ipynb 
test file - test.ipynb

To execute the above files the paths to training/feats, test/feats, training_label.json and testing_label.json are to be changed to appropriate as they are 
hardcoded in the code. 

Rest of details about the model and parameters are included in the report.
